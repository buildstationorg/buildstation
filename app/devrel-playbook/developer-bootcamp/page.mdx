# developer bootcamp

## introduction
A developer bootcamp is an intensive, structured training program designed to equip individuals with the necessary skills to become successful software developers. It serves as an effective onboarding platform for newer developers, enabling them to quickly adapt to the technological demands of the industry. Additionally, the bootcamp often rewards participants for their contributions and progress, incentivizing learning and development.

## platform of choice
buildstation highly recommends using GitHub as the place to host the bootcamp materials. GitHub provides a collaborative environment for developers to work together, share code, and track changes. Additionally, GitHub's version control system allows for easy management of the bootcamp content, and its issue tracking feature enables participants to report bugs, suggest improvements, and ask questions. For videos, we recommend using YouTube (free, accessible, great quality and helps build up the channel).

## curriculum
so buildstation doesn't want to dictate the contents here but we have some suggestions:
1. the bootcamp curriculum should be open-source and free for everyone to access.
2. the bootcamp curriculum should be updated regularly to reflect the latest changes and technologies in the crypto space.
3. the bootcamp curriculum should be comprehensive, going from easy to advanced topics.
4. the bootcamp curriculum should be interactive and engaging, with hands-on exercises and projects to help participants apply their knowledge.
5. the bootcamp curriculum should be accessible and inclusive, with materials available in multiple languages and formats to accommodate different learning styles.
