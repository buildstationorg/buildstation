# Global Variables

## Block and Transaction Properties
- `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)`: hash of the given block when `blocknumber` is one of the 256 most recent blocks; otherwise returns zero
- `block.basefee (uint)`: current block’s base fee
- `block.chainid (uint)`: current chain id
- `block.coinbase (address payable)`: current block miner’s address
- `block.gaslimit (uint)`: current block gaslimit
- `block.number (uint)`: current block number
- `block.timestamp (uint)`: current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- `gasleft() returns (uint256)`: remaining gas
- `msg.data (bytes calldata)`: complete calldata
- `msg.sender (address)`: sender of the message (current call)
- `msg.sig (bytes4)`: first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
- `msg.value (uint)`: number of wei sent with the message
- `tx.gasprice (uint)`: gas price of the transaction
- `tx.origin (address)`: sender of the transaction (full call chain)


## Error handling
- `assert(bool condition)`: causes a Panic error and thus state change reversion if the condition is not met - to be used for internal errors.
- `require(bool condition)`: reverts if the condition is not met - to be used for errors in inputs or external components.
- `require(bool condition, string memory message)`: reverts if the condition is not met - to be used for errors in inputs or external components. Also provides an error message.
- `revert()`: abort execution and revert state changes
- `revert(string memory reason)`: abort execution and revert state changes, providing an explanatory string

## Members of Address Types
- `<address>.balance (uint256)`: balance of the Address in Wei
- `<address>.code (bytes memory)`: code at the Address (can be empty)
- `<address>.codehash (bytes32)`: the codehash of the Address
- `<address payable>.transfer(uint256 amount)`: send given amount of Wei to Address, reverts on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
- `<address payable>.send(uint256 amount) returns (bool)`: send given amount of Wei to Address, returns false on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
- `<address>.call(bytes memory) returns (bool, bytes memory)`: issue low-level CALL with the given payload, returns success condition and return data, forwards all available gas, adjustable
- `<address>.delegatecall(bytes memory) returns (bool, bytes memory)`: issue low-level DELEGATECALL with the given payload, returns success condition and return data, forwards all available gas, adjustable
- `<address>.staticcall(bytes memory) returns (bool, bytes memory)`: issue low-level STATICCALL with the given payload, returns success condition and return data, forwards all available gas, adjustable

## Contract-related keywords
- `this`: The current contract, explicitly convertible to Address
- `super`: A contract one level higher in the inheritance hierarchy
- `selfdestruct(address payable recipient)`: Destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address and end execution. Note that selfdestruct has some peculiarities inherited from the EVM:
    - the receiving contract’s receive function is not executed.
    - the contract is only really destroyed at the end of the transaction and revert s might “undo” the destruction.
