# Units

## Common units
- `wei` is the smallest subdenomination of Ether (1 `wei` == 1)
- `gwei` is the commonly used subdenomination to describe gas price (1 `gwei` == 1e9)
- `ether` unit (1 `ether` == 1e18)

### Note
In Solidity, we will use integers for calculations and the language does not support the `float` type. The float representation issue causes rounding errors (`rounding`) that create logical holes for attack.

## Time units

- 1 == 1 `seconds`
- 1 `minutes` == 60 `seconds`
- 1 `hours` == 60 `minutes`
- 1 `days` == 24 `hours`
- 1 `weeks` == 7 `days`

**Example**
```solidity
function f(uint start, uint daysAfter) public {
    if (block.timestamp >= start + daysAfter * 1 days) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
