# our goals

## we are a builder community
`buildstation` is a community of builders that are passionate about building on Web3 to collaborate and share knowledge with each other.

- **openness**: we believe in the power of open source software and the importance of sharing knowledge with others.
- **transparency**: we believe in being transparent about our actions and decisions, and in holding ourselves accountable to the community.
- **decentralization**: we believe in the power of decentralized systems and the importance of giving control back to the people.
