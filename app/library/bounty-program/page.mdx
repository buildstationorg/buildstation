# Bounty program

## Introduction
A bounty program is an initiative that organizations launch to encourage individuals to contribute software, systems, or products into the ecosystem. By offering rewards or compensation for these contributions, the program aims to expand open source solutions within the ecosystem, grow the developer/builder community and create funnels for larger projects to explore.

## Sample requirements
Bounty adminstrators must set clear guides and requirements for contributions to make sure that the whole process is transparent and fair to all participants.
- Issue, PR, discussion formats.
- Rules on rewards or compensation.
